The purpose of this usability experiment is to find a user-friendly categorization of web pages from a popular website.\n\nYou will be presented with an already sorted model that you can modify however you please. Your task is to rearrange the cards into whatever categories appear to be most plausible to you. You may need to create new categories, delete existing ones or change their title in order to do that. Please do not be afraid of categorizing differently.\n\nAfter creating a category using the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-primary\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-plus-sign\"></span> Add Category</button> button, you can sort cards into the category via drag and drop. Some cards provide additional information behind a click on the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-info\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign\"></span></button> button. As the order of cards within categories is irrelevant, the cards are automatically sorted alphabetically.\n\nYou can click <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-success\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-floppy-disk\"></span> Save</button> at any time to save your current progress and come back to the experiment later. When you are finished, please click on <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-success\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-log-out\"></span> Save and Submit</button> to complete your participation. Please note that submission is only possible once all cards have been categorized. If you have troubles categorizing individual cards, simply create a <strong>Others</strong> category. After submitting, you can no longer change your model.\n\nYou can expand the screen by clicking on the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-default\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-fullscreen\"></span> Fullscreen</button> button at the top of the page.\n\nClick on <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-success\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-play\"></span> Start</button> to begin with the experiment.\nIf you do not wish to participate, please click on <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-danger\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-ban-circle\"></span> Do Not Participate</button> to end the experiment.\n\nYou can read this message again by clicking on the <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-info\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign\"></span> Welcome Message</button> button.\n\nThank you for your help."

Your task is to analyze this graph carefully and select categories for the final model of this usability experiment.\n\nYou can see all categories on the y-axis made by participants and all participants on the x-axis. The graph shows categories changes over participants. You can see by hovering on a point that how many cards were same from the categories of the previous participant. In the legend of the graph, you can see all categories and you can select a category by clicking on them for the final model of this usability experiment. When you click on these categories, those selected categories will be highlighted green on the right-hand side. These will be your selected categories for the final model.\n\nYou can see on upper left corner, a disabled button <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-success\" disabled><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-play\"></span>Show Suggested Solution</button>. You have to select at leat one category to make it enabled <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-success\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-play\"></span>Show Suggested Solution</button>.

You can drag these cards into your selected categories on right side or you can go back by clicking on <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-xs btn-default\" ><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-refresh\"></span> Back to Category Analysis</button> button and can select more categories so that system can place these cards according to the analysis algorithm.\n\nYou can also see more information about cards by hovering the pointer over this button <button class=\"btn btn-xs btn-info\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign\"></span></button>.
